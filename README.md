roots of reality, to guide me in the creative journey that is creating a world and different kinds of magic. It might grow out to be an actual playable game, but [I'll burn that bridge, when I get to it.](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=I%27ll%20burn%20that%20bridge%20when%20I%20get%20to%20it.)
